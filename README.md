The weather images that I used was made by me. You can use them for non commercial purposes. (ask for my consent first pls <3)
This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I made this for my own learning (I want to get familiar with the mentioned programming language.) So means, I didn't code it alone, I watched tutorial from youtube (please don't hate me, I did learn a lot from it.)
